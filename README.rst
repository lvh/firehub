=========

firehub is a Github notification broker.

Github notifications for large projects can be like drinking from the
firehose. Pretty much all of the information ends up in your e-mail
inbox. The aim of firehub is to distribute and filter notifications so
you only see the ones you actually care about, when and where you care
about them.

It is written in Python_ using the Twisted_ framework.
